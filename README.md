# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

This was based out of https://www.blog.duomly.com/implement-redux-saga-with-reactjs-and-redux/

### Tools used
* React, redux, react-redux with Saga
* React Hooks like useState, useEffect
* Redux Hooks like useSelector, useDispatch instead of mapDispatchToProps and mapStateToProps
* Used redux-actions which combines action creators and functions together
